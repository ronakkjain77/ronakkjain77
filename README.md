Hi, my name is Ronak Lodha and I am looking for opportunities in data analytics/data science.
Relevant skills include machine learning, problem-solving, programming, and creative thinking.
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in science (Information Technology, Bhavans College Mumbai).

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me, it is one big puzzle I want to solve.
Finding patterns nobody else sees is a challenge to me. Strong eye for detail and tenacity to never quit on something until it is absolutely perfect.

A few interesting things about me. I love to watch science fiction (my favorite is "Ready: Player One"). I am also an avid gamer.
I love to play competitive strategy games and first-person shooters. Lastly, I love learning.
Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or miscellaneous facts about the universe.
